# Plant-based-disease-detection

Crop diseases is a significant threat to food security, however their fast identification remains tough in several elements of the planet because of the shortage of the required infrastructure. Recent advances in the field of computer vision made possible for disease diagnosis from healthy and diseased plants through deep learning. In this project I am using PlantVillage dataset a publicly available dataset of diseased plant leaves collected under controlled conditions. Using CNN and Machine Learning can be use to identify the type of plant and what type of diseases plants have by their leaves condition and classification of healthy plants and diseased plants
